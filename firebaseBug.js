The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is invalid or missing required fields.  This often occurs when the `firebaseConfig` object in your initialization is incorrect.  It might be missing the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`, or `measurementId` values.  Another common problem involves typos in these field names.
